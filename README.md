# Django Snacks


## Problem Domain:

A Django website consists of a single project that is split into separate apps. The idea is that each app handles a self-contained function that the site needs to perform.

In this repo, I created a web site in Django with 2 pages:

* home page
* about page
* created views/urls/templates as needed for home and about pages
* Using ancestor template to contain navigation elements
